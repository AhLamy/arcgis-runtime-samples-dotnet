  "Description": "This sample demonstrates how to authenticate with ArcGIS Server using ArcGIS Tokens to access a secure service. Accessing secured services requires a login that's been defined on the server.",
  "Instructions": "1. When you run the sample, the app will load a map that contains a layer from a secured service.\n2. You will NOT be challenged for a user name and password to view that layer because that info has been hard-coded into the app.\n3. If the credentials in the code are correct, the secured layer will display, otherwise the map will contain only the public layers.",
